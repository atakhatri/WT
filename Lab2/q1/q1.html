    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b> is the standard markup language<sup>[a]</sup> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
    It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    <br><br>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
    <br><br>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
    With HTML constructs,images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,paragraphs,lists,links,quotes, and other items.
    HTML elements are delineated by <i>tags</i>, written using angle brackets.
    Tags such as <b>img</b> and <b>input</b> directly introduce content into the page.
    Other tags such as <b>p</b> and <b>/p</b> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
